# ReCoMatch: Boosting Region Consistency in Semi-supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation

This repository contains the official implementation of **ReCoMatch**, proposed in our paper **"ReCoMatch: Boosting Region Consistency in Semi-supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation"**. 

## Overview
ReCoMatch introduces a novel approach to improve weak-to-strong consistency methods, emphasizing the foreground-background paradigm to enhance segmentation performance, particularly in challenging medical imaging tasks. Our method effectively reduces edge uncertainty and improves robustness in texture-blurred scenarios.

## Code Availability
The code for ReCoMatch will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper. Stay tuned for updates!
